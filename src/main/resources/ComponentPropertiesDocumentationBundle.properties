javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.description=The description element is used to provide text describing the \
    parent element. The description element should include any \
    information that the portlet application war file producer wants \
    to provide to the consumer of the portlet application war file \
    (i.e., to the Deployer). Typically, the tools used by the \
    portlet application war file consumer will display the \
    description when processing the parent element that contains the \
    description. It has an optional attribute xml:lang to indicate \
    which language is used in the description according to \
    RFC 1766 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt). The default \
    value of this attribute is English("en").
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.name=The portlet-name element contains the canonical name of the \
    portlet. Each portlet name is unique within the portlet \
    application.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.display-name=The display-name type contains a short name that is intended \
    to be displayed by tools. It is used by display-name \
    elements.  The display name need not be unique.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.init-param=The init-param element contains a name/value pair as an \
    initialization param of the portlet
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.expiration-cache=Expiration-time defines the time in seconds after which the portlet output expires. \
    -1 indicates that the output never expires.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.mime-type=MIME type name, e.g. "text/html". \
    The MIME type may also contain the wildcard \
    character '*', like "text/*" or "*/*".
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.portlet-mode=Portlet modes. The specification pre-defines the following values \
    as valid portlet mode constants: \n\
    "edit", "help", "view". \n\
    Portlet mode names are not case sensitive.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.window-state=Portlet window state. Window state names are not case sensitive.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.resource-bundle=Name of the resource bundle containing the language specific \
    portlet informations in different languages (Filename without \
    the language specific part (e.g. _en) and the ending (.properties).
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.info.title=Locale specific static title for this portlet.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.info.short-title=Locale specific short version of the static title.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.info.keywords=Locale specific keywords associated with this portlet. \
   The kewords are separated by commas.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.preferences=Portlet persistent preference store.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.security-role-ref=The security-role-ref element contains the declaration of a \
    security role reference in the code of the web application. The \
    declaration consists of an optional description, the security \
    role name used in the code, and an optional link to a security \
    role. If the security role is not specified, the Deployer must \
    choose an appropriate security role. \
    The value of the role name element must be the String used \
    as the parameter to the \
    EJBContext.isCallerInRole(String roleName) method \
    or the HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole(String role) method.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.supported-processing-event=The event-definition-referenceType is used to reference events \
  declared with the event-definition element at application level.
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.supported-publishing-event=The event-definition-referenceType is used to reference events \
  declared with the event-definition element at application level."},
javax.portlet.Portlet.javax.portlet.supported-public-render-parameter=
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.icon=The icon element specifies an image that represents the portlet.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.virtual-path=The virtual-path value sets the virtual path used to override the default \
    servlet context path.\n\
    \n\
    For example, suppose your portlet is deployed to the servlet path\
    "/test-portlet". By default, the portal will return "/test-portlet" for the\
    servlet context path. You can override it by setting virtual-path to "/virtual"\
    and have the portal return "/virtual" for the servlet context path.\n\
    \n\
    The default value is "" which means this is not used.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.struts-path=Suppose the struts-path value is "mail". This tells the portal that all \
    requests with the path mail/* are considered part of this portlet's scope. Users \
    who request paths that match mail/* will only be granted access if they also \
    have access to this portlet. This is true for both portlet requests and regular \
    servlet requests.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.parent-struts-path=The parent-struts-path must be the struts-path of another portlet in the same \
    web application. The current portlet will be able to use all the struts \
    mappings of the parent without duplicating them in struts-config.xml.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.configuration-path=The configuration-path value is no longer available.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.friendly-url-mapping=The friendly-url-mapping specifies the mapping used to map a friendly URL prefix \
    to a specific portlet. For example, the Message Boards portlet has the mapping \
    "message_boards" and will map all friendly URL's that contains \
    "/-/message_boards" to itself.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.friendly-url-routes=The friendly-url-routes points to the XML file that defines the friendly URL \
    routes. This file is read by the class loader.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.control-panel-entry-category=Set the control-panel-entry-category value to "my" to make this portlet \
    available within the My Account administration of the user. Set the value to \
    "apps", "configuration", "sites", or "users" to make it available in the Control \
    Panel under that category. Set the value to "site_administration.configuration", \
    "site_administration.content", "site_administration.members" or \
    "site_administration.navigation" to make it available in the Site Administration \
    under that category. Legacy values from previous versions of Liferay will be \
    automatically mapped to the new values: "content" to \
    "site_administration.content", "portal" to "users", and "server" to "apps".
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.control-panel-entry-weight=Set the control-panel-entry-weight value to a double number to control the \
    position of the entry within its Control Panel category. Higher values mean \
    that the entry will appear lower in the Control Panel menu.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.preferences-company-wide=Set the preferences-company-wide value to true if the preferences for the \
    portlet are across the entire company. Setting this value to true means \
    the value for preferences-unique-per-layout and preferences-owned-by-group are \
    not used. The default value is false. \n\
    \n\
    For example, an administrator could set the preferences to an Announcements \
    portlet that would save a message in the portlet's preferences. This message \
    would then be used across all pages for that company. The portlet must not be \
    instanceable because instanceable portlets have uniquely generated portlet ids. \n\
    \n\
    The default behavior of the bundled Announcements portlet sets the instanceable \
    value to true so that normal users cannot create company wide messages. A future \
    release would include permissions for the edit mode versus the view mode which \
    would allow an administrator to set the message while users would just view the \
    message.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.preferences-unique-per-layout=Set the preferences-unique-per-layout value to true if the preferences for the \
    portlet are unique across all pages. If set to false, the preferences for the \
    portlet are shared across all pages. The default value is true. \n\
    \n\
    The preferences-unique-per-layout element is used in combination with the \
    preferences-owned-by-group element. See the comments for the \
    preferences-owned-by-group element for more information.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.preferences-owned-by-group=Set the preferences-owned-by-group value to true if the preferences for the \
    portlet are owned by the group when the portlet is shown in a group page. If \
    set to false, the preferences are owned by the user at all times. The default \
    value is true. \n\
    \n\
    Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to true and \
    preferences-owned-by-group set to false. Users can set a different list of \
    stocks for every personal page. Users can set a different list of stocks for \
    every community page. \n\
    \n\
    Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to false and \
    preferences-owned-by-group set to false. Users can set one list of stocks to be \
    shared across all personal pages. Users can set one list of stocks to be shared \
    across a community's set of pages. \n\
    \n\
    Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to true and \
    preferences-owned-by-group set to true. Users can set a different list of stocks \
    for every personal page. Administrators set the portlet preferences for users in \
    a community page. Administrators can set a different list of stocks for every \
    community page that are then shared by all users within a community. \n\
    \n\
    Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to false and \
    preferences-owned-by-group set to true. Users can set one list of stocks to be \
    shared across all personal pages. Administrators set the portlet preferences for \
    users in a community page. Administrators can set one list of stocks to be \
    shared by all users across a community's set of pages.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.use-default-template=Set the use-default-template value to true if the portlet uses the default \
    template to decorate and wrap content. Setting this to false allows the \
    developer to own and maintain the portlet's entire outputted content. The \
    default value is true. \n\
    \n\
    The most common use of this is if you want the portlet to look different from \
    the other portlets or if you want the portlet to not have borders around the \
    outputted content.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.show-portlet-access-denied=Set the show-portlet-access-denied value to true if users are shown the portlet \
    with an access denied message if they do not have access to the portlet. If set \
    to false, users are never shown the portlet if they do not have access to the \
    portlet. The default value is set in portal.properties. \n\
    \n\
    See: \n\
    \n\
    http://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.show-portlet-inactive=Set the show-portlet-inactive value to true if users are shown the portlet \
    with an inactive message if the portlet is inactive. If set to false, users are \
    never shown the portlet if the portlet is inactive. The default value is set in \
    portal.properties. \n\
    \n\
    http://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.action-url-redirect=Set the action-url-redirect value to true if an action URL for this portlet \
    should cause an auto redirect. This helps prevent double submits. The default \
    value is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.restore-current-view=Set the restore-current-view value to true if the portlet restores to the \
    current view when toggling between maximized and normal states. If set to false, \
    the portlet will reset the current view when toggling between maximized and \
    normal states. The default value is true.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.maximize-edit=Set the maximize-edit value to true if the portlet goes into the maximized state \
    when the user goes into the edit mode. This only affects the default portal \
    icons and not what may be programmatically set by the portlet developer. \
    The default value is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.maximize-help=Set the maximize-help value to true if the portlet goes into the maximized state \
    when the user goes into the help mode. This only affects the default portal \
    icons and not what may be programmatically set by the portlet developer. \
    The default value is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.pop-up-print=Set the pop-up-print value to true if the portlet goes into the pop up state \
    when the user goes into the print mode. This only affects the default portal \
    icons and not what may be programmatically set by the portlet developer. \
    The default value is true.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.layout-cacheable=Set the layout-cacheable flag to true if the data contained in this portlet can \
    will never change unless the layout or Journal portlet entry is changed.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.instanceable=Set the instanceable value to true if the portlet can appear multiple times on a \
    page. If set to false, the portlet can only appear once on a page. The default \
    value is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.remoteable=Set the remoteable value to true if the portlet can be used remotely like in \
    WSRP. If set to false, the portlet will not be available remotely. The default \
    value is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.scopeable=If the scopeable value is set to true, an administrator will be able to \
    configure the scope of the data of the portlet to either the current community \
    (default), the current layout, or the scope of any other layout of the community \
    that already exists. Portlets that want to support this must be programmed to \
    obtain the proper scope group id according to the configuration and scope their \
    data accordingly. The default is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.single-page-application=If the single-page-application value is set to true, portlet links uses Single \
    Page Application. The default is true.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.user-principal-strategy=Set the user-principal-strategy value to either "userId" or "screenName". \
    Calling request.getRemoteUser() will normally return the user id. However, some \
    portlets may need the user principal returned to be screen name instead.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.private-request-attributes=Set the private-request-attributes value to true if the portlet does not share \
    request attributes with the portal or any other portlet. The default value is \
    true. The property "request.shared.attributes" in portal.properties specifies \
    which request attributes are shared even when the private-request-attributes \
    value is true.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.private-session-attributes=Set the private-session-attributes value to true if the portlet does not share \
    session attributes with the portal. The default value is true. The property \
    "session.shared.attributes" in portal.properties specifies which session \
    attributes are shared even when the private-session-attributes value is true.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.autopropagated-parameters=Set the autopropagated-parameters value to a comma delimited list of parameter \
    names that will be automatically propagated through the portlet.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.requires-namespaced-parameters=Set the requires-namespaced-parameters value to true if the portlet will only \
    process namespaced parameters. The default value is true.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.action-timeout=The default value of action-timeout is 0. If set to a value greater than 0, \
    and monitoring-spring.xml is enabled via the property "spring.configs" in \
    portal.properties, and the property "monitoring.portlet.action.request" in \
    portal.properties is set to true, then the portlet's action phase processing \
    will be timed. If the execution time is longer than action-timeout, it will be \
    recorded as a timeout request processing. The time unit is millisecond.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.render-timeout=The default value of render-timeout is 0. If set to a value greater than 0, \
    and monitoring-spring.xml is enabled via the property "spring.configs" in \
    portal.properties, and the property "monitoring.portlet.render.request" in \
    portal.properties is set to true, then the portlet's render phase processing \
    will be timed. If the execution time is longer than render-timeout, it will be \
    recorded as a timeout request processing. The time unit is millisecond.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.render-weight=The default value of render-weight is 1. If set to a value less than 1, the \
    portlet is rendered in parallel. If set to a value of 1 or greater, then the \
    portlet is rendered serially. Portlets with a greater render weight have greater \
    priority and will be rendered before portlets with a lower render weight. \n\
    \n\
    If the ajaxable value is set to false, then render-weight is always set to 1 \
    if it is set to a value less than 1. This means ajaxable can override \
    render-weight if ajaxable is set to false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.ajaxable=The default value of ajaxable is true. If set to false, then this portlet can \
    never be displayed via Ajax.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.header-portal-css=Set the path of CSS that will be referenced in the page's header relative to the \
    portal's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.header-portlet-css=Set the path of CSS that will be referenced in the page's header relative to the \
    portlet's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.header-portal-javascript=Set the path of JavaScript that will be referenced in the page's header relative \
    to the portal's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.header-portlet-javascript=Set the path of JavaScript that will be referenced in the page's header relative \
    to the portlet's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.footer-portal-css=Set the path of CSS that will be referenced in the page's footer relative to the \
    portal's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.footer-portlet-css=Set the path of CSS that will be referenced in the page's footer relative to the \
    portlet's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.footer-portal-javascript=Set the path of JavaScript that will be referenced in the page's footer relative \
    to the portal's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.footer-portlet-javascript=Set the path of JavaScript that will be referenced in the page's footer relative \
    to the portlet's context path.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.css-class-wrapper=Set name of the CSS class that will be injected in the DIV that wraps this \
    portlet.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.facebook-integration=Set the facebook-integration value to either "fbml" or "iframe". The default \
    value is "iframe" because IFrame integration will work without requiring any \
    changes to your code. See the Message Boards portlet for minor changes that were \
    made to make it FBML compliant. Note that the Liferay tag libraries already \
    output FBML automatically if a request is made by Facebook.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.add-default-resource=If the add-default-resource value is set to false and the portlet does not \
    belong to the page but has been dynamically added, then the user will not have \
    permissions to view the portlet. If the add-default-resource value is set to \
    true, the default portlet resources and permissions are added to the page, and \
    the user can then view the portlet. This is useful (and necessary) for portlets \
    that need to be dynamically added to a page. However, to prevent security loop \
    holes, the default value is false. \n\
    \n\
    The properties "portlet.add.default.resource.check.enabled" and \
    "portlet.add.default.resource.check.whitelist" in portal.properties allow \
    security checks to be configured around this behavior.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.system=Set the system value to true if the portlet is a system portlet that a user \
    cannot manually add to their page. The default value is false.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.active=Set the active value to true if the portlet is active and available to users. \
    If set to false, the portlet will not be active or available to users. The \
    default value is true. \n\
    \n\
    This value can be changed at runtime via the Admin portlet.
javax.portlet.Portlet.com.liferay.portlet.display-category=
com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCActionCommand.javax.portlet.name=The portlet name associated to this action command.
com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCActionCommand.mvc.command.name=The command name to match with the parameter \
    value <code>ActionRequest.ACTION_NAME</code>. This name cannot contain any \
    comma (<code>,</code>)
com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCRenderCommand.javax.portlet.name=The portlet name associated to this render command.
com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCRenderCommand.mvc.command.name=The command name that matches the \
    parameter value <code>mvcRenderCommandName</code>. This name cannot contain \
    any comma (<code>,</code>).
com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCResourceCommand.javax.portlet.name=The portlet name associated to this resource command.
com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc.MVCResourceCommand.mvc.command.name=The command name that matches the \
    <code>ResourceID</code> of the resource request. This name cannot contain any \
    comma (<code>,</code>).
