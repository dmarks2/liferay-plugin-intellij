# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
# and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
# files that we want to exclude

## Xcode temporary files that should never be committed
# NB: NIB/XIB files still exist even on Storyboard projects, so we want this...
*~.nib

## Xcode build files -
# NB: slash on the end, so we only remove the FOLDER, not any files that were badly named "DerivedData"
