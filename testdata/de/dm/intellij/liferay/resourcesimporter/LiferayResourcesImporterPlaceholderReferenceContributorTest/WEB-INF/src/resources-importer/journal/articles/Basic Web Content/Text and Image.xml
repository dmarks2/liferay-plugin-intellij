			    <p>In the mid-20th century, after two of the
			    most violent wars in history, mankind turned
			    its gaze upwards to the stars. Instead of
			    continuing to strive against one another,
			    man choose instead to strive against the
			    limits that we had bound ourselves to. And
			    so the Great Space Race began.</p>

			    <p>At first the race was to reach space--get
			    outside the earth's atmosphere, and when
			    that had been reached, we shot for the moon.
			    After sending men to the moon, robots to
			    Mars, and probes beyond the reaches of our
			    solar system, it seemed that there was
			    nowhere left to go.</p>

			    <p>The Space Program aims to change that.
			    Beyond national boundaries, beyond what
			    anyone can imagine that we can do. The sky
			    is not the limit.</p>
